# 2-Tailed Test

You work at a large book store. Your manager believes that the colour of the store walls affect people's spending. Previously, your store had red interior and customers were spending $57 on average with a standard deviation of $20. Now the walls are green and the mean spend of the random sample of 80 customers you selected is $62. Has there been a significant (95% confidence) change in spend?
