# Hypothesis Testing

You are consultant engaged by a factory which manufactures spoons.

The factory executives recently spent $1,000,000 upgrading equipment and processes in order to combat excessively high defects in manufacturing (23%) which were leading to high return rates from clients.

You have been asked to prove (with a confidence level of 95%) that new equipment has improved the situation and that the number of defective spoons has decreased to under 18%. You have been supplied with a random sample of 150 spoons and found that 23% spoons have defects.
