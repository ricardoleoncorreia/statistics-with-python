# Distributions

You are an Analyst working for a high-end clothes design boutique.

The company is developing a new line of clothes for very tall people. Your team is analyzing the viability of the project from a sales perspective and your manager has asked you to assist with some input variables to help test the financial forecast.

You need two distributions:

* A normal distribution of 1000 observations for heights of men in the US
* A normal distribution of 1000 observations for heights of women in the US

Also, for each of the two populations, you have been asked to identify the minimum height of 2.2% of the tallest people in that population.
In the US, men's height have a mean of 69.1 inches (175,5 cm) and standard deviation 2.9 in (7,4 cm), while female's heights have a mean of 63.7 inches (161.8 cm) and standard deviation 2.7 inches (6.9 cm).
